Application of Metaheuristics for Localization, Energy and Path Optimization in Sensor Network

## Description
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are a collection of tiny sensor nodes with limited memory, processing power, and energy capacity. Sensor nodes are deployed randomly in a harsh environment like the forest, underground, water, etc. Sensors can sense the phenomenon in the environment, process it, and collectively communicate the information. The sensed information is useful only when its location is known. Some of the examples where location plays an important role include fire protection, traffic handling, animal habitat, and other emergency services. Localization is a process of creating location awareness in sensor nodes. The common approach is to use a global positioning system (GPS), however, this puts resource and financial constraints on tiny sensor nodes.  With this, only a few nodes can be installed with the GPS and they are known as anchors or beacons. The accurate estimation of sensor nodes in WSN with the minimum number of anchors is the critical issue. This project aims at accurate localization and addresses the challenges in localization such as mobility, energy, etc. The localization has been performed by conventional trilateration and the bio-inspired algorithms from the paradigm of swarm intelligence (SI). The metaheuristic algorithms from the field of SI are adaptive, robust, and simple and are based on the intelligent behavior of insects, birds, and other swarms in nature. The trilateration method from the conventional algorithms and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm have been used for localizing the senor nodes. The PSO is an optimization algorithm based on the social behavior of bird flocking. The results indicate that the PSO-based approach is more accurate than the trilateration method. The impact of accurate localization is also studied using a mobile anchor and on a less energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. In all the cases, the bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms perform better than conventional geometric methods.
